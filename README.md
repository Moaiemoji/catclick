A competitive clicking website for pros.

[Play](CatClick.html)

## Info
CatClick is a competitive clicking website with two modes: a battle royale mode (called MOBA) where you gain points by clicking and lose points from other people clicking,
and a clicking mode called CPS Test where you can test your click speed per second.

### How to Play MOBA
You can play the MOBA by going into the game and selecting MOBA on the lobby select menu. There is a log on the left of the screen that details when you get, by who you got hit, and other details. When the message "Go" is logged, you can start clicking and will start to recieve damage from other people.

### How to Play CPS Test
You can play the CPS Test by going into the game and selecting CPS Test on the lobby select menu. There is a log on the left of the screen that details when you need to go. When the message "Go" is logged, you can start clicking. The game will calculate your clicks per second.

#### Changing How Often CPS is Taken
If you want to change how often the CPS is taken, you can click the Settings icon and type in a new value, like 0.5 for a half second click test, and 5 for a 5 second click test. This changes the leaderboard your scores are registered in (0.5 seconds and up, 1 second and up, 5 seconds and up, 10 seconds and up).

#### Clicksounds
Catclick has clicksounds you can use to play a sound whenever you click. In the settings menu, there are two options to change: you can change how loud the sound plays in a percentage, and you can change the sound. The default sound is the click from a Bloody V8 (thanks [Clicket](https://github.com/spreyo/clicket) for the sounds).

### Stats
The game keeps track of stats for you. These stats are saved on your device. Some stats include your highest CPS on all different test lengths, your total clicks, and your badges.

#### Badges
Badges are rare achievements you can earn from doing special things, like reaching a CPS goal, donating to the website, or getting your highest CPS verified. You can view your badges on the stats page.

### GameJolt
CatClick has a feature where you can log into your GameJolt account and save your stats, save file, and even use leaderboards, all stored to your account. You can log into GameJolt through the main menu, or through the settings page.

#### Submitting Scores on Leaderboards
The game automatically detects when you have a score you can submit. If you get a new highest CPS in this session, it automatically prompts you to submit it to the leaderboard. You can include a message with your score. The leaderboard only saves your highest score. The minimum score for leaderboards is 5 CPS.

#### Viewing Stats of Others
When you are logged into a GameJolt account, you can go to the stats page. It will prompt you which user to look at the stats for. If you want to change it, remove your own name and add the user whose stats you want to view.

#### Saving your Cloud File
In the GameJolt menu, there is an option to back up your save file. This option backs up your save file to another device, so you can continue playing on that device.

#### Loading your Cloud File
In the GameJolt menu, you can load your save file. This allows you to take your cloud save file and load it on another device.

## Rules
As this game has online features, with the online features come some rules.
### Basic Rules
You must not use a program designed to take anything other than a left mouse click and turn it into a left mouse click.

You must not use a program designed to send left mouse clicks without you pressing the left mouse button (e.g. autoclickers).

If you must break any of these rules in this list, we politely request of you to do the following:

* Do not submit any scores to the leaderboard that break any of these rules
* Do not log into GameJolt so that your scores are saved online.
### Rules on Clicking
You may click using any method that sends one left click input every time you press down on the mouse.

Some automatically valid methods are:

* Normal clicks
* Jitter clicking
* Butterfly clicking

Drag clicking may be allowed, as long as you submit a video of your top run.

### Recording your Gameplay
When recording your clicks, make sure to record a video with an audio track of *isolated clicks*. Clicks must be on their own seperate audio track. The video must also include the website CatClick, showing the website open to that URL. Raw footage from livestreams are allowed. Make sure you turn off the clicksounds on the website, these do not count for the requirement.

We may grant exceptions to these rules if we see fit. Do not ask for an exception.
