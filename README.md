## Info
CatClick is a competitive clicking website with two modes: a battle royale mode (called MOBA) where you gain points by clicking and lose points from other people clicking,
and a clicking mode called CPS Test where you can test your click speed per second.

### How to Play MOBA
You can play the MOBA by going into the game and selecting MOBA on the lobby select menu. There is a log on the left of the screen that details when you get, by who you got hit, and other details. When the message "Go" is logged, you can start clicking and will start to recieve damage from other people.

### How to Play CPS Test
You can play the CPS Test by going into the game and selecting CPS Test on the lobby select menu. There is a log on the left of the screen that details when you need to go. When the message "Go" is logged, you can start clicking. The game will calculate your clicks per second.

#### Changing How Often CPS is Taken
If you want to change how often the CPS is taken, you can click the Settings icon and type in a new value, like 0.5 for a half second click test, and 5 for a 5 second click test. This changes the leaderboard your scores are registered in (0.5 seconds and up, 1 second and up, 5 seconds and up, 10 seconds and up).
